### Overview

This repo demonstrates three ways to use the Alchemy NFT api.

(1) Fetch all the NFTs that belong to an address.

(2) Fetch all the NFTs that belong to an address filtered by a particular contract/collection.

(3) Fetch all collections for which an address owns an NFT.

You can find additional Alchemy documentation for these methods here https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/enhanced-apis/nft-api/getnfts.
